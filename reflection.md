- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Inheritance makes my programming a lot more efficient and faster as I don't have to be repetitive when creating the constructors for each class. I also don't have to make a toString method for each class, I can just make one in the parent class. One thing I struggled with was creating methods in the Library class that had to do with Hashtables because I have never worked with them before. However, looking at the documentation for each method helped me figure out which methods to use and how to use them.
